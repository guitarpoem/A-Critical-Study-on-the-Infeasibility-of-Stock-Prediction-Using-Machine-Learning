# A-Critical-Study-on-the-Infeasibility-of-Stock-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This paper argues that reliable stock prediction using machine learning is infeasible. We show that LSTM models fail to outperform naive baselines, despite high R2 scores. Sentiment features add no value, aligning with the Efficient Market Hypothesis. ML struggles with the noisy, adversarial nature of financial markets.
